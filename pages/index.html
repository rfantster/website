Don't remember much of the first couple of years, but I think we moved to New Orleans when I was about 1 or 2 years old. <br>I must have been about 2 at the time of this photo.

  <h3>My Friend, Lightning</h3>
  <div>

   <table border="0px" style="width:98%">
  <tr>
    <td align:left>Not sure of this date.<br>
However, while in the New Orleans area, my dad and I used to ride horses a lot.
This is a picture of my brothers, Louis and Johnny, on the back of my pony, Lightning. I gave him the name Lightning for a valid reason, he and I ran many races against adults and their horses and seldom lost.

We also competed in numerous horse-shows, running barrels, stakes, and keyhole competitions, again, always running against adults and horses (not ponies).

  <tr>
    <td align:left>During the Summers of 1979 and 1980, friends and I would go camping for two to three weeks at a time, in a mountain range between Kenai and Anchorage, Alaska. <br>In those 2 to 3 weeks, we would likely see no trace of another human being. <br>This is me on the trail, overlooking a small water fall.

   <table border="0px" style="width:90%">
  <tr>
    <td align:left>We spent a considerable amount of time in the mountains around our home in Kenai, Alaska. <br>Hunting trips would take us several miles from any road, and had to be done on horseback.
This particular trip probably had us 20 miles from any other people. What a wonderful time we had then. This photo is of my dad and uncle sitting around the campfire, enjoying a cup of coffee.

Two weeks later we were married. We are about to celebrate 39 years together.

<br>I have never missed anyone like I missed her.
