Don't remember much of the first couple of years, but I think we moved to New Orleans when I was about 1 or 2 years old. <br>I must have been about 2 at the time of this photo.

    <td align:left>Not sure of this date.<br>
However, While in the New Orleans area, my dad and I used to ride horses a lot.
This is a picture of my brothers, Louis and Johnny, on the back of my pony, Lightning. I gave him the name Lightning for a valid reason, he and I ran many races against adults and their horses and seldom lost.

We also competed in numerous horse-shows, running barrels, stakes, and keyhole competitions, again, always running against adults and horses (not ponies).
