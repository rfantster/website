  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are: <br>
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

  <p>I walked away from my website that I built for my classroom work about a year and a half ago (July '21), thinking I'd never use the stuff.  Since then, I've 
wanted to piddle with a little coding but didn't have the web server to put it on.  Then I found GitHub, a place where I can create webspace for free.  
GitHub also gives me the capability to edit my pages online, no expensive editing software.  I have not coded for a couple of years now, so I think I'll 
go back and relearn some stuff.</p><br>
  <p>Of course, I HAD to find out if I could embed math symbols (LaTex), simply.  As you can tell from above, that wasn't a problem.</p>

  <p>I'm working on a "timeline" of events, pertaining to my life.<br>
    It's giving me an opportunity to refresh some knowledge using JQuery.<br>
